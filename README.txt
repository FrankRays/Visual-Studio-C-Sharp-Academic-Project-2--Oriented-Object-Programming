I developed this Visual Studio C# console application project for C# programming language course. The objective given was to simulate an application for bank account management using Oriented Object Programming.

This version 1.0 (Original Project) is created under Portuguese language for the interface, variables and comments. Sorry about that.

Feel free to use or make any changes to it.
